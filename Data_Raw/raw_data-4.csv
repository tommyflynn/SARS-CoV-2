"Notes"
"Averages for employer-sponsored plan deductibles are for private-sector employees."
""
"Averages for Marketplace plan deductibles are weighted by 2019 plan selections. This data includes plans with a $0 deductible. Plans with separate drug and medical deductibles are included."
""
"Under self-insured plans, employers assume financial responsibility for providing health benefits to their employees by paying health claims directly instead of contracting with an insurance company to cover those costs. Employers that self insure may contract with an insurance company to serve as a third party administrator for plan administration.  "
