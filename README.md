It is inconceivable that this pandemic will not leave the most vulnerable and oppressed peoples of our society in utter destitution. The national eye cannot bare but a glance at what this country is doing--or not doing--about black lives ending in unprecedented numbers. The American regard for life goes only as far as the front door, or perhaps the stop sign, but no further in this day and age.
